# Social Agenda
The goal of this project is to create a ‘social agenda’ application that will make it clear to Planify when employees will come to work and show up to certain events like cooking nights or getaways.
The website makes it easier for employees to see who will come to the office/events. It will also be easier for managers to announce and manage attendance to events.
